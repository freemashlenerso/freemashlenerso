How much a typical consumer pays to borrow small amounts of money—and whether that person is likely to be able to afford to repay that loan within the designated time—differs widely across states. This variation is largely the result of whether state regulations limit the costs of small loans and require that loans be repayable over time in affordable installments.

To better understand how effectively each state protects payday loan consumers, The Pew Charitable Trusts conducted an analysis of the payday lending marketplace and regulatory regimes in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The findings, captured in this interactive table, show the level of consumer safeguards in place, the most common payday loan product type, average annual percentage rate charged, and average cost to borrow $500 for four months.
