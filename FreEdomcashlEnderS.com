The payday loan market is quickly moving away from lump-sum lending and toward installment loans. The shift is driven in part by consumer preference and regulatory pressure, but in some instances lenders have used installment loan models to evade consumer protections that cover only shorter-term loans.

The CFPB’s proposed small-dollar loan rule will almost certainly accelerate this transition, but if it is going to benefit consumers, it must also be structured to ensure reasonable terms, affordability, and lower prices. To prevent new harm to borrowers, federal and state policymakers should take additional steps to resolve the four major problems with the small installment loan market: unaffordable payments, front-loaded charges that often lead to high rates of loan refinancing, excessive durations, and noncompetitive pricing. These issues can be solved by requiring that payments be affordable as determined by the borrower’s income, mandating that all charges be spread evenly over the term of the loan, limiting terms for small-dollar loans to six months in most cases, enacting price limits that are sustainable for borrowers and lenders that operate efficiently, and allowing lower-cost providers such as banks and credit unions to issue small loans sustainably.
