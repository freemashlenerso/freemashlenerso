The primary data sources include state regulatory reports, state laws, and advertised product pricing from the six largest payday loan chains in the U.S. Researchers from Pew reviewed available state regulatory reports on loans issued by payday lenders to determine the most common type of payday loan in each state. For states that have not published relevant data in the past three years, Pew compared advertised product options and pricing information from the six largest payday loan chains in the U.S. and used that information to calculate dollar costs and APRs.

In states that effectively limit loans to less than $500, dollar costs were based on the average maximum loan size offered. And for calculations of single-payment payday loan APRs, Pew researchers used the 14-day term such that the costs to borrow for four months equal eight pay cycles, or 112 days. For payday installment loans, monthly payments were calculated based on a four-month loan term.
